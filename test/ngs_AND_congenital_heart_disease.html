    <div class="panel-heading"><b>1. Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing in Patients with Non-syndromic Congenital Heart Disease.</b></div>
      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers a unique opportunity to sequence multiple genes at lower cost and effort compared to Sanger sequencing. We tested a targeted NGS of a specific gene panel in a relatively large population of non-syndromic CHD patients. The patient cohort comprised 68 CHD patients (45 males; 8.3 ± 1.7 years). Amplicon libraries for 16 CHD-strictly related genes were generated using a TruSeq® Custom Amplicon kit (Illumina, CA) and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequence data were processed through the MiSeq Reporter and wANNOVAR softwares. After applying stringent filtering criteria, 20 missense variants in 9 genes were predicted to be damaging and were validated by Sanger sequencing with 100% concordance. Fourteen variants were present in public databases with very rare allele frequency, of which four variants (p.Arg25Cys in NKX2-5, p.Val763Ile in ZFPM2, p.Arg1398Gln and Gly1826Asp in MYH6) have been previously linked to CHD or cardiomyopathy. The remaining six variants in four genes (GATA4, NKX2-5, NOTCH1, TBX1) were novel mutations, currently not found in public databases, and absent in 200 control alleles of healthy subjects. Four patients (5.8%) carried two missense variants (1 compound heterozygote in the same gene and 3 double heterozygotes in different genes), with possibly synergistic deleterious effects. Targeted NGS is a powerful and efficient tool to detect DNA sequence variants in multiple genes, providing the opportunity for discovery of the co-occurrence of two or more missense rare variants.</p>

    <div class="panel-heading"><b>2. A Novel Role for CSRP1 in a Lebanese Family with Congenital Cardiac Defects.</b></div>
      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Despite an obvious role for consanguinity in congenital heart disease (CHD), most studies fail to document a monogenic model of inheritance except for few cases. We hereby describe a first-degree cousins consanguineous Lebanese family with 7 conceived children: 2 died in utero of unknown causes, 3 have CHD, and 4 have polydactyly. The aim of the study is to unveil the genetic variant(s) causing these phenotypes using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Targeted exome sequencing identified a heterozygous duplication in CSRP1 which leads to a potential frameshift mutation at position 154 of the protein. This mutation is inherited from the father, and segregates only with the CHD phenotype. The in vitro characterization demonstrates that the mutation dramatically abrogates its transcriptional activity over cardiac promoters like NPPA. In addition, it differentially inhibits the physical association of CSRP1 with SRF, GATA4, and with the newly described partner herein TBX5. Whole exome sequencing failed to show any potential variant linked to polydactyly, but revealed a novel missense mutation in TRPS1. This mutation is inherited from the healthy mother, and segregating only with the cardiac phenotype. Both TRPS1 and CSRP1 physically interact, and the mutations in each abrogate their partnership. Our findings add fundamental knowledge into the molecular basis of CHD, and propose the di-genic model of inheritance as responsible for such malformations.</p>

    <div class="panel-heading"><b>4. Exome sequencing reveals novel IRXI mutation in congenital heart disease.</b></div>
      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Genetic variation in specific transcription factors during heart formation may lead to congenital heart disease (CHD) or even miscarriage. The aim of the present study was to identify CHD‑associated genes using next generation sequencing (NGS). The whole exome DNA sequence was obtained from a stillborn fetus diagnosed with tricuspid atresia and complete transposition of the great arteries using high‑throughput sequencing methods. Subsequently, genetic variants of CHD‑associated genes were selected and verified in 215 non‑syndromic CHD patients and 249 healthy control subjects using polymerase chain reaction combined with Sanger sequencing. Genetic variants of previously reported CHD‑inducing genes, such as cysteine rich with EGF like domains 1 and cbp/p300‑interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp rich carboxy‑terminal domain 2, were discovered through the NGS analysis. In addition, a novel non‑synonymous mutation of the iroquois homeobox 1 (IRX1) gene (p.Gln240Glu) was identified. A total of three non‑synonymous mutations (p.Gln240Glu, p.Ser298Asn and p.Ala381Glu) of the IRX1 gene were verified in 215 non‑syndromic CHD patients, but not in 249 healthy volunteers. The results demonstrated that NGS is a powerful tool to study the etiology of CHD. In addition, the results suggest that genetic variants of the IRX1 gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of CHD.</p>

    <div class="panel-heading"><b>5. Increasing Role of Titin Mutations in Neuromuscular Disorders.</b></div>
      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>The TTN gene with 363 coding exons encodes titin, a giant muscle protein spanning from the Z-disk to the M-band within the sarcomere. Mutations in the TTN gene have been associated with different genetic disorders, including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy and several skeletal muscle diseases.Before the introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS) methods, the molecular analysis of TTN has been laborious, expensive and not widely used, resulting in a limited number of mutations identified. Recent studies however, based on the use of NGS strategies, give evidence of an increasing number of rare and unique TTN variants. The interpretation of these rare variants of uncertain significance (VOUS) represents a challenge for clinicians and researchers.The main aim of this review is to describe the wide spectrum of muscle diseases caused by TTN mutations so far determined, summarizing the molecular findings as well as the clinical data, and to highlight the importance of joint efforts to respond to the challenges arising from the use of NGS. An international collaboration through a clinical and research consortium and the development of a single accessible database listing variants in the TTN gene, identified by high throughput approaches, may be the key to a better assessment of titinopathies and to systematic genotype- phenotype correlation studies.</p>

    <div class="panel-heading"><b>6. The Current Landscape of Genetic Testing in Cardiovascular Malformations: Opportunities and Challenges.</b></div>
      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Human cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) frequently have a genetic contribution. Through the application of novel technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, DNA sequence variants associated with CVMs are being identified at a rapid pace. While clinicians are now able to offer testing with NGS gene panels or whole exome sequencing to any patient with a CVM, the interpretation of genetic variation remains problematic. Variable phenotypic expression, reduced penetrance, inconsistent phenotyping methods, and the lack of high-throughput functional testing of variants contribute to these challenges. This article elaborates critical issues that impact the decision to broadly implement clinical molecular genetic testing in CVMs. Major benefits of testing include establishing a genetic diagnosis, facilitating cost-effective screening of family members who may have subclinical disease, predicting recurrence risk in offsprings, enabling early diagnosis and anticipatory management of CV and non-CV disease phenotypes, predicting long-term outcomes, and facilitating the development of novel therapies aimed at disease improvement or prevention. Limitations include financial cost, psychosocial cost, and ambiguity of interpretation of results. Multiplex families and patients with syndromic features are two groups where disease causation could potentially be firmly established. However, these account for the minority of the overall CVM population, and there is increasing recognition that genotypes previously associated with syndromes also exist in patients who lack non-CV findings. In all circumstances, ongoing dialog between cardiologists and clinical geneticists will be needed to accurately interpret genetic testing and improve these patients&#39; health. This may be most effectively implemented by the creation and support of CV genetics services at centers committed to pursuing testing for patients.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by a trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular myocardial recesses that communicate with the left ventricular cavity. Several genetic causes of LVNC have been reported, with variable modes of inheritance, including autosomal dominant and X-linked inheritance, but relatively few responsible genes have been identified. A NGS workflow, based on a panel of 95 genes developed for sequencing most prevalent sudden cardiac death-causing genes, was used to make a rapid and costless molecular diagnosis in two siblings with a severe noncompaction cardiomyopathy starting prenatally and leading to rapid cardiac failure. For the first time, a total homozygous PKP2 deletion was identified. This molecular defect was further confirmed by MLPA and array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Heterozygous PKP2 mutations are usually reported in a significant proportion of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy cases. Our results show, for the first time, the involvement of PKP2 in severe cardiomyopathy with ventricular non compaction.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Down syndrome (DS) is one of the commonest disorders with huge medical and social cost. DS is associated with number of phenotypes including congenital heart defects, leukemia, Alzeihmer&#39;s disease, Hirschsprung disease etc. DS individuals are affected by these phenotypes to a variable extent thus understanding the cause of this variation is a key challenge. In the present review article, we emphasize an overview of DS, DS-associated phenotypes diagnosis and management of the disease. The genes or miRNA involved in Down syndrome associated Alzheimer&#39;s disease, congenital heart defects (AVSD), leukemia including AMKL and ALL, hypertension and Hirschprung disease are discussed in this article. Moreover, we have also reviewed various prenatal diagnostic method from karyotyping to rapid molecular methods -  MLPA, FISH, QF-PCR, PSQ, NGS and noninvasive prenatal diagnosis in detail.</p>

    <div class="panel-heading"><b>12. Outlier-based identification of copy number variations using targeted resequencing in a small cohort of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot.</b></div>
      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Copy number variations (CNVs) are one of the main sources of variability in the human genome. Many CNVs are associated with various diseases including cardiovascular disease. In addition to hybridization-based methods, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are increasingly used for CNV discovery. However, respective computational methods applicable to NGS data are still limited. We developed a novel CNV calling method based on outlier detection applicable to small cohorts, which is of particular interest for the discovery of individual CNVs within families, de novo CNVs in trios and/or small cohorts of specific phenotypes like rare diseases. Approximately 7,000 rare diseases are currently known, which collectively affect ∼6% of the population. For our method, we applied the Dixon&#39;s Q test to detect outliers and used a Hidden Markov Model for their assessment. The method can be used for data obtained by exome and targeted resequencing. We evaluated our outlier-based method in comparison to the CNV calling tool CoNIFER using eight HapMap exome samples and subsequently applied both methods to targeted resequencing data of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. In both the HapMap samples and the TOF cases, our method is superior to CoNIFER, such that it identifies more true positive CNVs. Called CNVs in TOF cases were validated by qPCR and HapMap CNVs were confirmed with available array-CGH data. In the TOF patients, we found four copy number gains affecting three genes, of which two are important regulators of heart development (NOTCH1, ISL1) and one is located in a region associated with cardiac malformations (PRODH at 22q11). In summary, we present a novel CNV calling method based on outlier detection, which will be of particular interest for the analysis of de novo or individual CNVs in trios or cohorts up to 30 individuals, respectively.</p>

    <div class="panel-heading"><b>13. Application of high-throughput sequencing for studying genomic variations in congenital heart disease.</b></div>
      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Congenital heart diseases (CHD) represent the most common birth defect in human. The majority of cases are caused by a combination of complex genetic alterations and environmental influences. In the past, many disease-causing mutations have been identified; however, there is still a large proportion of cardiac malformations with unknown precise origin. High-throughput sequencing technologies established during the last years offer novel opportunities to further study the genetic background underlying the disease. In this review, we provide a roadmap for designing and analyzing high-throughput sequencing studies focused on CHD, but also with general applicability to other complex diseases. The three main next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms including their particular advantages and disadvantages are presented. To identify potentially disease-related genomic variations and genes, different filtering steps and gene prioritization strategies are discussed. In addition, available control datasets based on NGS are summarized. Finally, we provide an overview of current studies already using NGS technologies and showing that these techniques will help to further unravel the complex genetics underlying CHD.</p>

    <div class="panel-heading"><b>14. Massively parallel sequencing and identification of genes for primary lymphoedema: a perfect fit.</b></div>
      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Primary lymphoedema is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by disruption of the lymphatic system. To date, the majority of the causative genes in primary lymphoedema have been identified through linkage analysis in large families with multiple affected subjects. Studies aimed at isolating additional genes responsible for primary lymphoedema have been hampered by cohorts comprised primarily of sporadic cases and small affected kindreds. In the absence of genetic heterogeneity, recent development of massively parallel DNA sequencing technology, specifically exome sequencing, has provided novel paradigms for disease gene identification in such cohorts. In this review, we summarize the novel approaches to disease gene discovery with massively parallel sequencing also known as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), and show how the selection of unrelated affected cases from clinically homogenous phenotypic subclassifications is proving to be a successful approach for disease gene discovery in primary lymphoedema.</p>
