29485202	Systems analysis of dilated cardiomyopathy in the next generation sequencing era.	2018-Feb-27	Harakalova M, Asselbergs FW	Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a form of severe failure of cardiac muscle caused by a long list of etiologies ranging from myocardial infarction, DNA mutations in cardiac genes, to toxics. Systems analysis integrating next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based omics approaches, such as the sequencing of DNA, RNA, and chromatin, provide valuable insights into DCM mechanisms. The outcome and interpretation of NGS methods can be affected by the localization of cardiac biopsy, level of tissue degradation, and variable ratios of different cell populations, especially in the presence of fibrosis. Heart tissue composition may even differ between sexes, or siblings carrying the same disease causing mutation. Therefore, before planning any experiments, it is important to fully appreciate the complexities of DCM, and the selection of samples suitable for given research question should be an interdisciplinary effort involving clinicians and biologists. The list of NGS omics datasets in DCM to date is short. More studies have to be performed to contribute to public data repositories and facilitate systems analysis. In addition, proper data integration is a difficult task requiring complex computational approaches. Despite these complications, there are multiple promising implications of systems analysis in DCM. By combining various types of datasets, for example, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, or 4C, deep insights into cardiac biology, and possible biomarkers and treatment targets, can be gained. Systems analysis can also facilitate the annotation of noncoding mutations in cardiac-specific DNA regulatory regions that play a substantial role in maintaining the tissue- and cell-specific transcriptional programs in the heart.

29457878	Genetic determinants of heart failure: facts and numbers.	2018-Feb-19	Czepluch FS, Wollnik B, Hasenfu√ü G	The relevance of gene mutations leading to heart diseases and hence heart failure has become evident. The risk for and the course of heart failure depends on genomic variants and mutations underlying the so-called genetic predisposition. Genetic contribution to heart failure is highly heterogenous and complex. For any patient with a likely inherited heart failure syndrome, genetic counselling is recommended and important. In the last few years, novel sequencing technologies (named next-generation sequencing - NGS) have dramatically improved the availability of molecular testing, the efficiency of genetic analyses, and moreover reduced the cost for genetic testing. Due to this development, genetic testing has become increasingly accessible and NGS-based sequencing is now applied in clinical routine diagnostics. One of the most common reasons of heart failure are cardiomyopathies such as the dilated or the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nearly 100 disease-associated genes have been identified for cardiomyopathies. The knowledge of a pathogenic mutation can be used for genetic counselling, risk and prognosis determination, therapy guidance and hence for a more effective treatment. Besides, family cascade screening for a known familial, pathogenic mutation can lead to an early diagnosis in affected individuals. At that timepoint, a preventative intervention could be used to avoid or delay disease onset or delay disease progression. Understanding the cellular basis of genetic heart failure syndromes in more detail may provide new insights into the molecular biology of physiological and impaired cardiac (cell) function. As our understanding of the molecular and genetic pathophysiology of heart failure will increase, this might help to identify novel therapeutic targets and may lead to the development of new and specific treatment options in patients with heart failure.

29455155	Newly designed 11-gene panel reveals first case of hereditary amyloidosis captured by massive parallel sequencing.	2018-Feb-17	Chyra Kufova Z, Sevcikova T, Januska J, Vojta P, Boday A, Vanickova P, Filipova J, Growkova K, Jelinek T, Hajduch M, Hajek R	Amyloidosis is caused by deposition of abnormal protein fibrils, leading to damage of organ function. Hereditary amyloidosis represents a monogenic disease caused by germline mutations in 11 amyloidogenic precursor protein genes. One of the important but non-specific symptoms of amyloidosis is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Diagnostics of hereditary amyloidosis is complicated and the real cause can remain overlooked. We aimed to design hereditary amyloidosis gene panel and to introduce new next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to investigate hereditary amyloidosis in a cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of unknown significance.
